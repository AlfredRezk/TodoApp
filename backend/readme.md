## Documentation
- Use Swagger-autogen and redoc to create documentation
- Use swagger-ui-express to serve swagger-autogen json file
- Documentations  at /api/documents


## Code Related Suggestions
- NPM scripts for dev and production env
- Config file for important constants
- Use controller methods with documented descriptions/routes
- Error handling middleware
- Authentication middleware for protecting routes and setting user roles
- Validation using Mongoose and no external libraries
- Use async/await (use express-async-errors to clean up controller methods)
